            The Greek here (<span class="greek" lang="el">σημαίνω</span>) can be compared with English "semaphore," a traffic signal.  The red, yellow, and green light protocol familiar to most in the culture of the US would mean nothing to a person from a completely different culture--there is no natural or inherent meaning to the colors or sequence or number, etc.  But as the familiar traffic light is used everywhere from waiting rooms to classrooms because it is familiar, so also are the symbols of the Revelation familiar to the culture of God's people: they all have their origin in the rest of the Scriptures.

        Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.' But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the LORD. Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, 'As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so has he dealt with us.'

        Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of <em>Melchizedek</em>, rather than one named after the order of <em>Aaron</em>?
        For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
        For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
        For it is evident that our Lord was descended from <em>Judah</em>, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.

            Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
            <br>
            Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.

        Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet and implored him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live."  And he went with him.

        When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it. And behold, there stood before me one having the appearance of a man.  And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai, and it called, "Gabriel, make this man understand the vision."  So he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face. But he said to me, "Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end."  And when he had spoken to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground. But he touched me and made me stand up.  He said, "Behold, I will make known to you what shall be at the latter end of the indignation, for it refers to the appointed time of the end."

        Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god. Who is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and set it before me, since I appointed an ancient people. Let them declare what is to come, and what will happen. Fear not, nor be afraid; have I not told you from of old and declared it? And you are my witnesses! Is there a God besides me? There is no Rock; I know not any."

        Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I called! I am he; I am the first, and I am the last. My hand laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand forth together. "Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
        <br>
        Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it out to the end of the earth; say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!"

        God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, "I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption...."
        <br>
        For he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
