Song of Solomon

# Chapter 5 #

## 5:1 ##
"I came to my garden, my sister, my bride, I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!"

### my sister, my bride ###
>**1 Corinthians 9:5**
Do we not have the right to take along a [sister, a] wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
μὴ οὐκ ἔχομεν ἐξουσίαν ἀδελφὴν γυναῖκα περιάγειν...?
