            The same word (<span class="greek" lang="el">σκοπέω</span>) is used in Philippians 3:17, where it is rendered "keep your eyes on."  However, in Philippians these are watched for the good they do. Nonetheless, even Philippians contrasts these good examples immediately with the same kind of evil detailed here.

                Brothers, join in imitating me, and <em>keep your eyes on</em> those who walk according to the example you have in us. For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.

            This entire phrase is one entity in the Greek: "those who." They are making both divisions and obstacles. The divisions and obstacles are both contrary to the doctrine.

            Note that we are to watch out for people who do such things.  There is a subtle but important difference between watching out for divisions and watching out for people who cause them.  Compare:

            "Smooth talk" is literally "plausible or useful talk." (see <a href="http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=117708">Liddell & Scott</a>)<br>
            
            In 1 Peter, the "useful" or "good" is tasted in the Lord through the milk of the word:

            "Flattery" is elsewhere rendered "blessing." (see <a href="http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=45586">Liddell & Scott</a>)
