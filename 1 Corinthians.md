# 1 Corinthians
## 10:24
> Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.

1. The rule for determining the right course of action is not seeking what is *allowed* but rather pursuing what is *beneficial*.
1. Compare: "Love your neighbor as yourself."

## 10:25-26
> Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience. For "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof."

1. The referenced Psalm 24 includes "clean hands and a pure heart."  Compare:
  * **Matthew 15:2, 11** Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.... It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.
  * **Luke 6:45** The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.

1. Citing Psalm 24:1-6
> The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,
    the world and those who dwell therein,
 for he has founded it upon the seas
    and established it upon the rivers.
 Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?
    And who shall stand in his holy place?
 He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
    who does not lift up his soul to what is false
    and does not swear deceitfully.
 He will receive blessing from the Lord
    and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
 Such is the generation of those who seek him,
    who seek the face of the God of Jacob.
