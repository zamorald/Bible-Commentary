  <blockquote cite="https://www.ancient.eu/pergamon/">
    Pergamon reached the height of its influence during the Hellenistic period, becoming the capital of the Attalid kings. During the Roman period the city was the first capital of the Asian province, but it eventually lost this status to local rival, Ephesus.
    Under Hadrian (117-138 CE), the city was favoured by several imperial initiatives. It was granted the title of metropolis and as a result of this an ambitious building programme was carried out: massive temples, a stadium, a theatre, a huge forum, and an amphitheatre were constructed. In addition, at the city limits the shrine to Asclepius (the god of healing) was expanded into a lavish spa.
    The archaeological site of Pergamon has provided many fine works of Hellenistic and Roman art but perhaps the most impressive is the altar which now resides in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.

<h4 class="comment">Antipas my faithful witness</h4>
<p class="comment">
  A New Testament "witness" actually laid eyes on the events or persons about whom they testify.  Whether Antipas became a witness of Christ as Stephen had in Acts 7:56, or had been in Judea in the time of Jesus (compare 2 Corinthians 5:16), or was among the "more than five hundred brothers" who saw Him after His resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15:6 is not known.  Both Christ standing when Stephen died and here mentioning Antipas by name illustrate Christ's regard for the lives of His saints.

<h4 class="scripture">
Psalm 116:16-17
Precious in the sight of the LORD
is the death of his saints.
O LORD, I am your servant;
I am your servant, the son of your maidservant.
You have loosed my bonds.
