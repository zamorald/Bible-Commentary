        <p>
            Peter opens his letter, 2 Peter, with the two-fold idea that we already have and are established in the truth, and he as an apostle is uniquely qualified to remind us of these things after his death (by means of these letters).  Peter warns us that there will be false teachers among us, and that people will scoff at any idea of accountability when they see time passing.  He closes by calling on us to keep ourselves pure and maintain spiritual stability in the face of these challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jude intends very pointedly to take Peter's dying thoughts seriously.  Jude starts his letter (verse 3) "very eager to write...about our common salvation," but instead finds it "<em>necessary</em> to write appealing to you to contend for the faith."  This opening tells us clearly salvation is not something we have in common anymore because we have failed to follow Peter's instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The letter of Jude, unique among all books of the Bible, teaches precisely from the perspective we all have had since the days the apostles walked the earth.  Jude points to the writings of the apostles, quoting them verbatim and applying what they said, as we also do today.  Peter had said we have the prophetic word made sure.  What need is there for Jude, then?  It stands as an example to us: This is how to use the Bible.  Every human being anywhere on earth who has taught anything valuable since that time has done what Jude did: quote the Bible and demand obedience to it.
