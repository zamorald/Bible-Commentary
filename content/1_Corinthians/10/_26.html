                The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,     <br>
                &#9;the world and those who dwell therein,            <br>
                 for he has founded it upon the seas                  <br>
                &#9;and established it upon the rivers.               <br>
                 Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?               <br>
                &#9;And who shall stand in his holy place?            <br>
                 He who has clean hands and a pure heart,             <br>
                &#9;who does not lift up his soul to what is false    <br>
                &#9;and does not swear deceitfully.                   <br>
                 He will receive blessing from the Lord               <br>
                &#9;and righteousness from the God of his salvation.  <br>
                 Such is the generation of those who seek him,        <br>
                &#9;who seek the face of the God of Jacob.            <br>
