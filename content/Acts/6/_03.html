            Better is, "seven husbands."

            The Greek here (<span class="greek" lang="el">ἀνήρ</span>) is not the generic term for a person; rather it specifically indicates a "husband."
            This is consistent with the instructions from Paul captured in 1 Timothy 3.

                    Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.

            With the number of the disciples approaching 10,000 (see the <a href="#increasingInNumber">comment on verse 1</a> above), these seven deacons simply cannot be doing all the work themselves.
            While obviously not forbidden from taking on any specific tasks, they must generally be what we would consider foremen or managers, overseeing the work being done and assigning jobs to individuals to do in coordination.
            A church following the Scriptures would have individuals subject to the requests and assignments of the deacons.
