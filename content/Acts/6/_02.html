        <p class="comment">
            The apostles here first define the purpose and work of deacons.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            The Greek word transliterated "deacon" (<span class="greek" lang="el">διάκονος</span>) is a compound of "through" and "dust."  It denotes someone who gets dirty--a laborer, servant, server.  These are boots-on-the-ground, the working class, the doers of society.  This term is used to show the office oversees logistical business as distinguished from spiritual business.  In this passage, the deacons' focus is the logistics of ensuring consistent and complete coverage in providing food and care for widows in the church.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to note several forms of this same "deacon," or "through the dust," root appear in this passage:
            <blockquote class="scripture w3-panel w3-leftbar">
                <p class="w3-theme-d2">
                    <cite>
                        <a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Acts/6/#1">Acts 6:1, 2, 4</a>
                    </cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily <em>distribution</em> [<span class="greek" lang="el">διακονία</span>]. <br>
                    And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God <em>to serve tables</em> [<span class="greek" lang="el">διακονέω</span>]...." <br>
                    But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the <em>ministry</em> [<span class="greek" lang="el">διακονία</span>] of the word.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            Immediately there are two kinds of "deacon," or "through the dust": literal and spiritual.  The deacons ensure literal labor is done to care for the widows, while the apostles remain dedicated to the spiritual labor of teaching the word of God.

            We also note importantly some specifics regarding who can serve as a deacon.

            We learn further details on appointing deacons from the first letter of Paul to Timothy (see <a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}1_Timothy/3/#8">1 Timothy 3:8-13</a>).

                    Deacons...must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
                </p>

            It is clear Paul's instructions make for the kind of persons appointed here in Acts 6.
            If they are to resolve issues meeting the needs of widows from all cultural backgrounds, deacons must avoid the pitfalls common to any entrusted with funds for distribution:
            <ul>
                <li>A "dignified" deacon will show all due respect to an elderly widow, regardless of her social or economic status.</li>
                <li>While "double-tongued" does refer to dishonesty, it is also a play on the Hellenist deacons' bilingualism--they must not take advantage of people's language barriers or ridicule them, as is a temptation for people who speak a language others present do not.</li>
                <li>"Addiction" and "dishonest gain" go hand in hand and must absolutely be rejected.</li>
                <li>And the "clear conscience" of the deacon sees no distinction between the Judean and the Hellenist widow--these sisters in Christ are all children of God.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
