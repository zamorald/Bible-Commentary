            Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.

        <h4>Satan Attacks the Church with Plausible Accusations of Bias</h4>
        <p>
            The Hellenists came from many foreign countries to worship in Jerusalem at Pentecost (<a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Acts/2/#5">Acts 2:5</a>).
            They stayed when they realized the kingdom of God had been established, selling off their foreign holdings (<a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Acts/4/#32">Acts 4:32–35</a>).
            The term "Hellenist" refers to the fact they spoke Greek, since Greek had been the common tongue after Alexander the Great spread it as far as India.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems likely the Hellenists spoke Hebrew, even if not quite with the fluency or familiar accent of the native Judeans.
            But certainly Hellenists and Judeans held to differing customs, modes of dress, cultural norms, and many other details--as persons of different nationality and tongue do.
            The important thing, of course, is the faith they <em>all</em> held in common.  This faith comes to define a new kind of nation:
            <blockquote class="scripture">
                <cite>Galatians 6:15-16</cite>
                Neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Adversary, Satan, takes advantage of the circumstances.
            As a rule, the church's widows are being cared for in a daily distribution of goods, but we find here some of the newly transplanted widows were being missed.
            This problem leaves the church open to accusations of bias.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likely, this problem arose from honest mistakes in bringing multiple cultures together.
            Some widows may have been known only by name to the church, if their health was such that they could not attend in person as a rule.
            The logistics of door-to-door delivery may well be complex--and only more so with a language barrier.
            Differing customs regarding family living arrangements, different items on the shopping list, or other such (mostly cultural) differences could account for not realizing some needs had not in fact been met.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satan insinuates, however, that the problem reflects the existence of a first- and a second-class citizenship in the kingdom of God.  The Judean natives are portrayed as more privileged, more likely to be seen and heard, to have their needs met.  The Hellenists are invited to look down on the Judeans' (perceived) lack of sacrifice to be here, and to question their dedication to the mission.  The misperception of plain and simple partiality could equally be had on both sides.  This truly is a delicate matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The apostles' solution in verses <a href="#2">2-3</a> is perfect. The people nominate (<a href="#5">verse 5</a>) and the apostles appoint (<a href="#6">verse 6</a>) individuals who will oversee the distribution to ensure all needs are met--not just for the Hellenists, but for the entire church.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the people put forth seven Greek surnames.  These men would be able to communicate in the common tongue with Christians from every nation.  The Judeans would be subject to the directions of these Hellenists in providing for material needs in the congregation.  The arrangement completely squashes any allegation of bias or partiality, since we are all subject to one another in love.

        <h4>Support of Widows</h4>
        
        <p class="comment">
            We know they supported qualified widows on a regular, ongoing basis.  The money for the widows' care and provisions came from the treasury, established in <a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Acts/4/#32">Acts 4:32–35</a>.  The deacons handled logistics and tasking of individual members to do the work.

            The use of the word "burden" does not imply the service of widows is a begrudged obligation.  It simply denotes the ability of the congregation to provide sufficient funds for those who are truly in need--those who have no other to care for them and rely on God--and us.
