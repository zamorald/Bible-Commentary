        <h4>Satan Attacks the Church with Plausible Accusations of Bias</h4>
        <p>
            The Hellenists came from many foreign countries to worship in Jerusalem at Pentecost (<a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Acts/2/#5">Acts 2:5</a>).
            They stayed when they realized the kingdom of God had been established, selling off their foreign holdings (<a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Acts/4/#32">Acts 4:32–35</a>).
            The term "Hellenist" refers to the fact they spoke Greek, since Greek had been the common tongue after Alexander the Great spread it as far as India.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems likely the Hellenists spoke Hebrew, even if not quite with the fluency or familiar accent of the native Judeans.
            But certainly Hellenists and Judeans held to differing customs, modes of dress, cultural norms, and many other details--as persons of different nationality and tongue do.
            The important thing, of course, is the faith they <em>all</em> held in common.  This faith comes to define a new kind of nation:
            <blockquote class="scripture">
                <cite>Galatians 6:15-16</cite>
                Neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Adversary, Satan, takes advantage of the circumstances.
            As a rule, the church's widows are being cared for in a daily distribution of goods, but we find here some of the newly transplanted widows were being missed.
            This problem leaves the church open to accusations of bias.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likely, this problem arose from honest mistakes in bringing multiple cultures together.
            Some widows may have been known only by name to the church, if their health was such that they could not attend in person as a rule.
            The logistics of door-to-door delivery may well be complex--and only more so with a language barrier.
            Differing customs regarding family living arrangements, different items on the shopping list, or other such (mostly cultural) differences could account for not realizing some needs had not in fact been met.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satan insinuates, however, that the problem reflects the existence of a first- and a second-class citizenship in the kingdom of God.  The Judean natives are portrayed as more privileged, more likely to be seen and heard, to have their needs met.  The Hellenists are invited to look down on the Judeans' (perceived) lack of sacrifice to be here, and to question their dedication to the mission.  The misperception of plain and simple partiality could equally be had on both sides.  This truly is a delicate matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The apostles' solution in verses <a href="#2">2-3</a> is perfect. The people nominate (<a href="#5">verse 5</a>) and the apostles appoint (<a href="#6">verse 6</a>) individuals who will oversee the distribution to ensure all needs are met--not just for the Hellenists, but for the entire church.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the people put forth seven Greek surnames.  These men would be able to communicate in the common tongue with Christians from every nation.  The Judeans would be subject to the directions of these Hellenists in providing for material needs in the congregation.  The arrangement completely squashes any allegation of bias or partiality, since we are all subject to one another in love.

            The use of the word "burden" does not imply the service of widows is a begrudged obligation.  It simply denotes the ability of the congregation to provide sufficient funds for those who are truly in need--those who have no other to care for them and rely on God--and us.

        <p class="comment">
            The apostles here first define the purpose and work of deacons.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            The Greek word transliterated "deacon" (<span class="greek" lang="el">διάκονος</span>) is a compound of "through" and "dust."  It denotes someone who gets dirty--a laborer, servant, server.  These are boots-on-the-ground, the working class, the doers of society.  This term is used to show the office oversees logistical business as distinguished from spiritual business.  In this passage, the deacons' focus is the logistics of ensuring consistent and complete coverage in providing food and care for widows in the church.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to note several forms of this same "deacon," or "through the dust," root appear in this passage:
            <blockquote class="scripture w3-panel w3-leftbar">
                <p class="w3-theme-d2">

                    </cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily <em>distribution</em> [<span class="greek" lang="el">διακονία</span>]. <br>
                    And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God <em>to serve tables</em> [<span class="greek" lang="el">διακονέω</span>]...." <br>

                </p>
            </blockquote>

            Immediately there are two kinds of "deacon," or "through the dust": literal and spiritual.  The deacons ensure literal labor is done to care for the widows, while the apostles remain dedicated to the spiritual labor of teaching the word of God.

            It is clear Paul's instructions make for the kind of persons appointed here in Acts 6.
            If they are to resolve issues meeting the needs of widows from all cultural backgrounds, deacons must avoid the pitfalls common to any entrusted with funds for distribution:
            <ul>
                <li>A "dignified" deacon will show all due respect to an elderly widow, regardless of her social or economic status.</li>
                <li>While "double-tongued" does refer to dishonesty, it is also a play on the Hellenist deacons' bilingualism--they must not take advantage of people's language barriers or ridicule them, as is a temptation for people who speak a language others present do not.</li>
                <li>"Addiction" and "dishonest gain" go hand in hand and must absolutely be rejected.</li>
                <li>And the "clear conscience" of the deacon sees no distinction between the Judean and the Hellenist widow--these sisters in Christ are all children of God.</li>

            While obviously not forbidden from taking on any specific tasks, they must generally be what we would consider foremen or managers, overseeing the work being done and assigning jobs to individuals to do in coordination.
            A church following the Scriptures would have individuals subject to the requests and assignments of the deacons.

            Laying on of hands is an "elementary doctrine" according to <a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Hebrews/6/#1">Hebrews 6:1-3</a>.
            It denotes approval, direct involvement, and selection or appointment.

                    And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, "Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it." And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them.

                    When James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.

                    I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God.

                    While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.

            The powerful effect of following God's pattern cannot be overstated.
            The connection between feeding the widows and watching the word of God increase may not be obvious on first glance.
            Ancient Israel's military strategy was neither--they trusted in the Lord to provide the victory.
            So we today adhere to His word and see the results God can get and not man.
