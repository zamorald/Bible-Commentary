            Better is, "...the Holy Spirit's gift."<br>
            
            There is much controversy among English speakers over whether the Holy Spirit is Himself the gift that is received by those who believe.  There is no controversy in the Greek: the gift is given by the Holy Spirit to those who repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.<br>
            
            In order for the Holy Spirit Himself to be the gift spoken of in this verse--like "the Isle of Capri" where the Isle **is** Capri--"the Holy Spirit" would have to be in apposition, with case, number, and gender matching "the gift."  But in fact "the gift" is a feminine accusative while "the Holy Spirit" is a neuter genitive.
            
            <blockquote class="scripture w3-panel w3-leftbar">
                <span class="greek" lang="el">καὶ λήμψεσθε τὴν δωρεὰν τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος</span>
            </blockquote>

            Some have spoken of the genitive being indeterminate, with the fact leaving us no choice but to resolve the controversy by using the context of the Bible.  It is never a bad idea to use the Bible to resolve all controversy, and the genitive is indeed indeterminate, but the question is not whether the Spirit is gift or giver.  The question is whether the Spirit is <em>giver or receiver</em>.  And the context has answered this question: "...you shall receive...."<br>

            The genitive in English features the same indeterminacy.  If someone were to notice a wrapped box on the kitchen table and ask you what it is, you could reply, "My parents' gift."  And if you leave it at that, without any other clues, the one who asked cannot know whether the gift is from your parents for you (and simply unopened) or whether you have prepared this gift for your parents (when they arrive for a visit later).  However, the one who asked would never think from this answer that the box actually contains your parents!
