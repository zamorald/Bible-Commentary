            The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.

            It is excellent when a person desires to serve the Lord and His people, and especially when a person is willing to work in the capacity of an elder.
            We must remember the admonition of the Holy Spirit if we wish to encourage men to serve in this office:

            The (Dis)Qualifications of Elders
        </h4>
        <p class="comment">
            The qualities listed here are intended to remind us what is qualified Christian living so that we can recognize those among us who are approved by God.
        </p>

            A word of warning is in order since Satan would love nothing better than to convince the church we cannot and should not have elders.
            Too often, this list is used to <em>disqualify</em> men who wish to serve rather than as a reminder of the qualities we seek.
            The qualifications turn into disqualifications when people interpret this list in such unreasonable terms that <em>no one</em> can satisfy them.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            These requirements are simply specifics of <em>faitfhulness</em>.  They remind us of the qualities that characterize a life of faith.  They are not intended to be tricky or impossible to attain--at least, not any more so than it is to remain faithful to God.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            On closer inspection, the qualities described here are applicable <em>generally</em>.  That is, there isn't any quality in the list that is not required of <em>every</em> Christian.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            Obviously, we do not mean that every Christian is required to be a man, a husband, a father.  Not every Christian must be those things or even can be those things, although an elder certainly must.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            But if a Christian is a husband, <em>this</em> is the kind of husband he <em>must</em> be if he is to be right with God.  If he is a father, this is the kind of father he must be.
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            Consider the items in this list.  What Christian is allowed <em>not</em> to be "above reproach?"  What Christian is allowed to practice polygamy?  To be drunk, out of control, shameful, rude, unable to tell someone else how to be saved?  To get in fist fights and loud arguments?  To love money?
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            If a Christian is a father, but he is <em>not</em> an elder, is he therefore allowed to let his children go out of control?
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            What Christian is allowed to stay immature forever?  Or, what Christian is allowed to be puffed up with conceit?  What Christian can be right with God and be an infamous criminal at the same time?
        </p>
        <p class="comment">
            If we have any among us who walk in any of these sins, we are obligated to discipline them (1 Corinthians 5:4-5).  This list does not define an unattainable super-man to be appointed as elder.  It requires a faithful husband and father who has demonstrated (by means of his children) that people can obey the gospel under his leadership.  That's hard enough.
