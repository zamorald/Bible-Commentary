            The Greek here (<span class="greek" lang="el">μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα</span>) emphasizes the number "one" since polygamy was very common in the region.<br>

            Resist the urge to interpret this requirement as only married once; Greek has a way of denoting repetitive action, and it isn't used here.<br>

            A man remains qualified, for example, though twice married if he survived his first wife and has married again.  A divorced but remarried man remains qualified if he divorced his first wife on the grounds of fornication (Matthew 19:9).<br>

            Remember the rule: these requirements are simply specifics of <em>faitfhulness</em>.
            Every married person must be like the elder in this respect.  If we have any husband--whether he desires to be an elder or not--who is <em>not</em> the "husband of one wife," we must withdraw from him because he is in sin (1 Corinthians 5:4-5).
