            <p class="comment">
                The Greek word translated "recent convert" (<span class="greek" lang="el">νεόφυτος</span>) only appears in this verse in the New Testament.  It literally means "newly planted," which can be seen in how the Septuagint uses it: Job 14:9; Psalm 128:3; Psalm 144:12; Isaiah 5:7.
            </p>

            <p class="comment">
                The teaching of Jesus compares individuals who hear His word to the soil and resultant plants where the seed is sown (Luke 8:4–18; Matthew 15:13).
                When Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 3:6, "I planted, Apollos watered...," he is referring to the fact he was the first to teach the gospel in Corinth (see also 1 Corinthians 1:14–16).
            </p>

            <p class="comment">
                <p>
                    How recent is "recent"?  There are two ways to reckon.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    One way is to keep the comparison to plants started in Jesus' teaching and implied by the word "neophyte."
                    The difference between a new planting and a full-grown plant is fruit.
                    If a plant produces fruit whose seed has produced viable plants, it is no longer a new planting but a mature plant.
                    When a Christian can be shown to sow the seed that makes faithful Christians, he is no longer a neophyte.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The other way to reckon recency is to use Acts as a timeline for the appointment of elders at Ephesus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The men who would become the elders at Ephesus obeyed the gospel in 19:5.

                    The amount of time that passed between their initial obedience to the gospel and their summons in an official capacity must have been enough time to be considered "not a neophyte" (<a href="#6">6</a>).<br>

                    Paul spent three years actually preaching in Ephesus.

                                And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.

                    Paul departed Ephesus for Macedonia in 20:1, and he wrote the first letter to Timothy during this time.

                    The instructions we here comment on in 1 Timothy 3 are for appointing the very same elders who would be summoned in Acts 20:17.

                    The time between Paul's departure from Ephesus in Acts 20:1 and Paul's summons from Miletus in 20:17 seems less than a year.

                    After departing Ephesus, he first passed through Macedonia and spent three months in Greece.

                    This timeline from Acts has Timothy appointing men who had obeyed the gospel a little over three years ago.

                    Some have suggested a man sheds his neophyte qualities only after many, many years--even 30 years.
                    (Contrast Hebrews 5:11–14.)
                    This assertion is entirely unbiblical.
                    Any proposed amount of time must fit between Acts 19:5 and Acts 20:17.
