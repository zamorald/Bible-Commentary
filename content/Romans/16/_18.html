            For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.

            Although they actually cause divisions and lay traps, their <em>words</em> seem plausible and uplifting.<br>
            
            "Smooth talk" is literally "plausible or useful talk." (see <a href="http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=117708">Liddell & Scott</a>)<br>
            
            In 1 Peter, the "useful" or "good" is tasted in the Lord through the milk of the word:

            <blockquote class="scripture">
                <cite><a href="{{ base_path }}1_Peter/2/#2">1 Peter 2:2</a></cite><br>
                Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation--if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is <em>good</em>.
            </blockquote>

            "Flattery" is elsewhere rendered "blessing." (see <a href="http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=45586">Liddell & Scott</a>)

                The cup of <em>blessing</em> that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ?

            This word (<span class="greek" lang="el">ἄκακος</span>) is literally, "unknowing of ill, guileless; innocent, simple." (see <a href="http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#eid=2997">Liddell & Scott</a>)
