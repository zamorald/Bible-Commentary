                Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre,   <br>
                and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD:                  <br>
                "You were the signet of perfection,                      <br>
                full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.                    <br>
                You were in Eden, the garden of God;                     <br>
                every precious stone was your covering,                  <br>
                sardius, topaz, and diamond,                             <br>

                and crafted in gold were your settings                   <br>
                and your engravings.                                     <br>
