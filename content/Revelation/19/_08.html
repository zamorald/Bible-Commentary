                    Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish....<br>

                    I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
