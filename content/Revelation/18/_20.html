                    "Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me;        <br>
                    he has crushed me;                                          <br>
                    he has made me an empty vessel;                             <br>
                    he has swallowed me like a monster;                         <br>
                    he has filled his stomach with my delicacies;               <br>
                    he has rinsed me out.                                       <br>
                    The violence done to me and to my kinsmen be upon Babylon," <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the inhabitant of Zion say.     <br>
                    "My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,"              <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Jerusalem say.                  <br>
                    Therefore thus says the LORD:                               <br>
                    "Behold, I will plead your cause                            <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take vengeance for you.         <br>
                    I will dry up her sea                                       <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make her fountain dry,          <br>
                    and Babylon shall become a heap of ruins,                   <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the haunt of jackals,               <br>
                    a horror and a hissing,                                     <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without inhabitant.                 <br>
