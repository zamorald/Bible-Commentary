        But you are a chosen race, a <em>royal priesthood</em>, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.

        Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be <em>priests</em> of God and of Christ, and they will <em>reign</em> with him for a thousand years.

        Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of <em>Melchizedek</em>, rather than one named after the order of <em>Aaron</em>?
        For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
        For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
        For it is evident that our Lord was descended from <em>Judah</em>, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.

        The <em>scepter</em> shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.

        And Melchizedek <em>king</em> of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was <em>priest</em> of God Most High.)
