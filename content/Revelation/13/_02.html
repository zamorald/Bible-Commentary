            And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.

            The Ten-Headed Beast of Daniel 7

            The four animals seen in Daniel are combined into one in the Revelation.

                And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another.<br>
                The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it.<br>
                And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, 'Arise, devour much flesh.'<br>
                After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it.<br>
                After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.<br>

            In Daniel, we are given a firm interpretation:

                I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things.

            Daniel also closes the discussion firmly, saying, "<span class="scripture">Here is the end of the matter.</span>" (<span class="scripture">Daniel 7:28</span>)

        <p class="comment">
            The story in Daniel can be outlined as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Vision of the beasts or animals (7:3-8)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vision of the throne room or court of God (7:9-10)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Destruction of the great beast, persistence of the lesser beasts (7:11-12)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vision of the Son of Man and His everlasting kingdom (7:13-14)

            The first answer to Daniel assures us the saints will receive and possess the kingdom of heaven no matter the opposition from earthly kingdoms.

                These four great beasts are four kings who shall arise out of the earth. But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, forever and ever.

            Daniel's next question addresses the beast overpowering the saints for a time:

                As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them, until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom.

            And the answer indicates there is a temporary victory for evil, but assures us again that it is only temporary.

But the court shall sit in judgment, and his dominion shall be taken away, to be consumed and destroyed to the end.

            Daniel summarizes all as follows:
            <blockquote class="scripture w3-panel w3-leftbar">
                <cite><a class="w3-hover-shadow" href="{{ base_path }}Daniel/7/#27">Daniel 7:27</a></cite><br>
                And the kingdom and the dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom shall be an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

            The meaning for the Revelation is clear. The saints will prevail in the kingdom of God no matter the opposition from earthly power, and despite all appearances. It may seem that evil is in control and will never be defeated, but the truth is God has already limited the time.

        </h4>
        <p class="comment">
            As the true God has granted His Son power, a throne, and all authority, so also Satan mimics the arrangement. The Bible tells us Satan will imitate God, and his imitations are paltry. Accept no substitutes!<br>

                Such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.

                The mystery of lawlessness is already at work.... The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
