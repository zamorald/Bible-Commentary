            He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.'

                And he said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. And he said to them, "To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that "'they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be forgiven.'" And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?

                And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand? For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear." And he said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you. For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away."

                To whom shall I speak and give warning,                    <br>
                that they may hear?                                        <br>
                Behold, their ears are uncircumcised,                      <br>
                they cannot listen;                                        <br>
                behold, the word of the LORD is to them an object of scorn;<br>
                they take no pleasure in it....                            <br>

                For from the least to the greatest of them,                <br>
                everyone is greedy for unjust gain;                        <br>

                everyone deals falsely.                                    <br>
                They have healed the wound of my people lightly,           <br>
                saying, 'Peace, peace,'                                    <br>
                when there is no peace.                                    <br>
                Were they ashamed when they committed abomination?         <br>
                No, they were not at all ashamed;                          <br>
                they did not know how to blush....                         <br>

                Thus says the LORD:                                        <br>
                "Stand by the roads, and look,                             <br>
                and ask for the ancient paths,                             <br>
                where the good way is; and walk in it,                     <br>
                and find rest for your souls.                              <br>
                But they said, 'We will not walk in it.'                   <br>
                I set watchmen over you, saying,                           <br>
                'Pay attention to the sound of the trumpet!'               <br>
                But they said, 'We will not pay attention.'                <br>
