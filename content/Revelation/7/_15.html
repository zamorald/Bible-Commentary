                Oh, how abundant is your goodness,                <br>
                which you have stored up for those who fear you   <br>
                and worked for those who take refuge in you,      <br>
                in the sight of the children of mankind!          <br>
                In the cover of your presence you hide them       <br>

                you store them in your shelter                    <br>
