                A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.    <br>
                O LORD, how many are my foes!                           <br>
                Many are rising against me;                             <br>
                many are saying of my soul,                             <br>
                "There is no salvation for him in God." Selah           <br>
                ...Salvation belongs to the LORD;                       <br>
                your blessing be on your people! Selah                  <br>
