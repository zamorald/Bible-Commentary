                As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <br>
                You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. <br>
                Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. <br>

                For thus says the One who is high and lifted up,    <br>
                who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:  <br>
                "I dwell in the high and holy place,    <br>
                and also with him who is of a contrite and lowly spirit,    <br>
                to revive the spirit of the lowly,  <br>
                and to revive the heart of the contrite.    <br>
                For I will not contend forever, <br>
                nor will I always be angry; <br>
                for the spirit would grow faint before me,  <br>
                and the breath of life that I made. <br>
                Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry, <br>
                I struck him; I hid my face and was angry,  <br>
                but he went on backsliding in the way of his own heart. <br>
                I have seen his ways, but I will heal him;  <br>
                I will lead him and restore comfort to him and his mourners,    <br>
                creating the fruit of the lips. <br>
                Peace, peace, to the far and to the near," says the LORD,   <br>
                "and I will heal him.   <br>
                But the wicked are like the tossing sea;    <br>
                for it cannot be quiet, <br>
                and its waters toss up mire and dirt.   <br>
                There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."

                From the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach is satisfied;   <br>
                he is satisfied by the yield of his lips.                   <br>
                Death and life are in the power of the tongue,              <br>
                and those who love it will eat its fruits.
