                    Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,                     <br>
                    O God of my salvation,                                      <br>
                    and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.        <br>
                    O Lord, open my lips,                                       <br>
                    and my mouth will declare your praise.                      <br>
                    For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;  <br>
                    you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.              <br>
                    The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;                  <br>
                    a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
