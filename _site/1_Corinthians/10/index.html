                    The rule for determining the right course of action is not seeking what is <em>allowed</em> but rather pursuing what is <em>beneficial</em>.

            The referenced <a href="/Psalms/24">Psalm 24</a> includes "clean hands and a pure heart."  Compare:
            <blockquote class="scripture">
                <cite><a href="/Matthew/15/#2">Matthew 15:2, 11</a></cite><br>
                "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat...."<br>
                "It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person."

            <blockquote class="scripture">
                <cite><a href="/Luke/6/#45">Luke 6:45</a></cite><br>
                The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
