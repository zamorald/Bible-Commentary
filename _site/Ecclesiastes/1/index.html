            What has a guaranteed just result?
        </h4>

        <p>
            The point of the book is that life has only one guaranteed just outcome: <span class="scripture">"God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil." (12:14)</span>  Therefore, <span class="scripture">"fear God and keep his commandments" (12:13)</span>, because there is nothing else a person can do on earth that has a guaranteed result.
        </p>
        <p>
            This point is argued as follows. The king has all the access and privilege the world can bestow (1:12–14, 17).  He decides to search for what is worthwhile in life.  The king's definition of what is good for man to do emerges over the course of the book: what is worthwhile has a lasting, repeatable, fair and just result.
        </p>
        <p>
            The king uses his access and privilege to try all life's pursuits, from pleasure to work--even family.  For each of these, he tests the outcome--is it reliable?  Is it lasting?  Is it fair?  Without fail, his research finds the outcome is not guaranteed.  In fact, there is often a marked disparity between the expected outcome and the reality.

                (7:14)

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The king cites relevant proverbs as he considers each matter, but not necessarily as the solution for the observed disparity.  He often wishes to cross-examine these proverbs and indict them as too broad.  He does not condemn the proverb outright or even wish to prove it not helpful.  Rather he places a finer point on their place in wisdom: proverbs are just that--proverbial.  A proverb describes a typical or predictable outcome, but it is not strictly a formula for how things will turn out in real life in every case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ecclesiastes hereby establishes its place alongside the Proverbs.  Proverbs provide an excellent prescription for what ought to be done from the start; Ecclesiastes addresses what we actually see happen in the end, incongruous though it may be with the proverbial expectation.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we fail to see this subtle but important distinction between the use of Proverbs and the use of Ecclesiastes, we may well fall prey to glaring errors of hasty generalization.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="scripture w3-panel w3-leftbar">
            "Train up a child in the way he should go;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even when he is old he will not depart from it."<br>
            <cite>
                (Proverbs 22:6)
            </cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The proverb means what it says--a parent should make every effort to set a child on the path that will lead to success (whether spiritual or material) in adult life.  And they often do.  But do not think the proverb is a formula that can be reverse-engineered: If an old man makes bad choices in life, we would be remiss to scan his upbringing to learn why he strayed from what is right at this late date.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the closing chapters, the king advises us to consider our mortality before the all-powerful creator, and to do so before there are clear indicators our time on earth is drawing to a close (12:1–7).  There's no use in waiting to repent, because you may never get the chance to see any signs.  <span class="scripture">"...Time and chance happen to them all. For man does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them." (9:11–12)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, the book's major thrust is that we have only one thing we can do that absolutely will produce a fair, right, lasting, and certain result: fear God and keep his commandments.  Whoever does this will inherit eternal life, as also the New Testament says, <span class="scripture">Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.... And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up." (Galatians 6:7, 9)</span>
