# Chapter 4 #


## 1 ##
"Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it."

## 2 ##
"For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened."

## 3 ##
"For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest,'" although his works were finished from the foundation of the world."

## 4 ##
"For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.""

## 5 ##
"And again in this passage he said, "They shall not enter my rest.""

## 6 ##
"Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,"

## 7 ##
"again he appoints a certain day, "Today," saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.""

## 8 ##
"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on."

## 9 ##
"So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,"

## 10 ##
"for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his."

## 11 ##
"Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience."

## 12 ##
"For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart."

## 13 ##
"And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account."

## 14 ##
"Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."

## 15 ##
"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin."

## 16 ##
"Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
