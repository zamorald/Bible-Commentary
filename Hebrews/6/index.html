            This is a point of departure from which to move on beyond the "elementary principles" and start learning how to interpret the Old Testament and understand the figure of Melchizedek.<br>
            Nevertheless, these verses <em>do</em> provide a handy list of the fundamental elements:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    repentance from dead works
                </li>
                <li>
                    faith toward God
                </li>
                <li>
                    instruction about <em>baptism</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    laying on of hands
                </li>
                <li>
                    resurrection of the dead
                </li>
                <li>
                    eternal judgment
                </li>
            </ol>

                And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. And he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they said, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism." And Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus." On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
