            Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?

            a believing wife

            This phrase is better rendered, "a sister, a wife," for two chief reasons.  It follows the original, <span class="greek" lang="el">μὴ οὐκ ἔχομεν ἐξουσίαν ἀδελφὴν γυναῖκα περιάγειν...?</span>  And it makes clear the reference to the Song of Solomon.

            <blockquote class="scripture">
                <cite><a href="/Song_of_Solomon/4/#9">Song of Songs 4:9-10, 12</a></cite><br>
                You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.  <br>
                How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice...!      <br>
                A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed.                                                                     <br>

                I came to my garden, my sister, my bride,                                                           <br>
                I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk.  <br>
                Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!                                                        <br>
