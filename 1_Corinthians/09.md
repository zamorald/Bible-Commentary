1 Corinthians
=============

# Chapter 9 #

## 9:5 ##
"Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?"

### a believing wife ###
This phrase is better rendered, "a sister, a wife," for two chief reasons.  It follows the original, μὴ οὐκ ἔχομεν ἐξουσίαν ἀδελφὴν γυναῖκα περιάγειν...?  And it makes clear the reference to the Song of Solomon.

>**Song of Songs 4:9-10, 12**
You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride; you have captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your oils than any spice...!
A garden locked is my sister, my bride, a spring locked, a fountain sealed.
>**Song of Songs 5:1**
I came to my garden, my sister, my bride,
I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk.
Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!
