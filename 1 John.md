# 1 John
## 2:8
> the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining

- Compare 2 Peter 1:19
> And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts

- Compare 1 Corinthians 13:12
> Now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.

## 2:21, 27
>21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.

>27 But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie--just as it has taught you, abide in him.

- Compare 2 Peter 1:12
> Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have.
